Include exact coordinates in format (x, y) for all locations\n3. For introverted agents: you can plan prep time, but PRESERVE the event time\n   Example: \"8:00 PM - 8:15 PM: Prep for party, 8:15 PM - 9:00 PM: Attend party at (x,y)\"\n\nVIOLATION EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):\n\u274c Invitation: \"party at 8:15 PM\" \u2192 Plan: \"10:15 PM: Attend party\" (WRONG - rescheduled!)\n\u274c Invitation: \"party at 8:15 PM\" \u2192 Plan: \"8:00 PM: Prep, 10:15 PM: Attend\" (WRONG - changed time!)\n\nCORRECT EXAMPLES:\n\u2705 Invitation: \"party at 8:15 PM\" \u2192 Plan: \"8:15 PM - 9:00 PM: Attend party at (200, 150)\"\n\u2705 Invitation: \"party at 8:15 PM\" \u2192 Plan: \"8:00 PM - 8:15 PM: Prep, 8:15 PM - 9:00 PM: Attend party at (200, 150)\"",
