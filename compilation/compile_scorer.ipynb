The agent has a specific goal and personality, and the observation is presented as a piece of information that may be relevant to the agent's goal. This task requires the assistant to consider the agent's personality traits, their goal, and the observation itself to assign a score based on its relevance to the agent's goal.\n",

The agent has a specific goal and personality, and the observation is presented as a piece of information that may be relevant to the agent's goal. This task requires the assistant to consider the agent's personality traits, their goal, and the observation itself to assign a score based on its relevance to the agent's goal.\n",

            "- `observation`: A piece of information that may be relevant to the agent's goal.\n",
            "- `agent_goal`: The agent's primary goal, which is a string describing what the agent is trying to achieve.\n",

            "  - 3-4: Mildly interesting but not actionable\n",

            "- The agent's goal can influence their response to the observation, with agents focused on building relationships being more likely to prioritize social interactions.\n",
            "- The observation can be related to the agent's goal in various ways, such as directly impacting their plans or goals, or being a conversation starter that can help build relationships.\n",
            "- The agent's personality traits can also influence their ability to provide emotional support to others, which may indirectly benefit the community.\n",

            "- The assistant should be able to handle observations that are related to the agent's goal, but may not be immediately actionable.\n",
            "- The assistant should be able to handle agents with complex personality traits or goals, and adapt its strategy accordingly.\n",
