## Current Project State

### Baseline Performance (From Day 3)
- **±2 Accuracy**: 77.5% (31/40 seeds)
- **MAE**: 1.45
- **Exact matches**: 16/40 (40.0%)
- **Target**: ±2 accuracy > 85% (+10% improvement)

### Weakest Categories (Prime Targets for Compilation)
1. **Mundane**: 17% accuracy (needs +43% improvement)
2. **Emotional**: 67% accuracy (some extreme cases missed)
3. **Low scores (1-3)**: 43% accuracy (over-scoring bias)

### Seeds Ready
- ✅ 40 diverse seeds in `seeds/scorer_v1.json`
- ✅ All score ranges 1-10 represented
- ✅ 6 categories covered
- ✅ Rationale documented

---

## Next Steps: Running Compilation

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Upload `compilation/compile_scorer.ipynb`
3. Upload `seeds/scorer_v1.json`
4. Enter GROQ_API_KEY when prompted
5. Run all cells
6. Wait 4-6 hours for completion
7. Download results from Google Drive

### Option 2: Local Jupyter (Not Recommended)
- Requires local GPU (compilation slow on CPU)
- Install: `pip install jupyter`
- Run: `jupyter notebook compilation/compile_scorer.ipynb`

---

## Expected Compilation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Setup (Today)** | 3.5 hours | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Upload to Colab | 15 minutes | ⏳ Next |
| Run compilation | 4-6 hours | ⏳ Unattended |
| Evaluate results | 30 minutes | ⏳ After run |
| Download & test | 15 minutes | ⏳ After run |
| **Total Elapsed** | **8-10 hours** | |
| **Active Time** | **4.5 hours** | |

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Setup Phase (COMPLETE)
- [x] Colab notebook created and tested
- [x] Loading utilities implemented
- [x] Backend integration complete
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] Config updated

### ⏳ Compilation Phase (TO BE RUN)
- [ ] Notebook runs without errors in Colab
- [ ] Compilation completes in 4-6 hours
- [ ] ±2 accuracy improves by ≥10% (77.5% → 85%+)
- [ ] MAE remains ≤1.5 or improves
- [ ] Mundane category improves from 17% → 60%+

## Technical Highlights

### GEPA Optimizer Configuration
```python
optimizer = GEPA(
    metric=importance_metric,
    budget=40,  # Fewer rollouts than MIPROv2 (40 vs 50-100+)
    verbose=True
)
```

**Why GEPA**:
- 30-40% faster than MIPROv2 (saves 2-3 hours)
- Fewer rollouts = less Groq API usage
- Reflective prompt evolution approach
- Similar API to MIPROv2 (easy to swap)

### Importance Metric Design
```python
def importance_metric(example, pred, trace=None):
    error = abs(pred_score - gold_score)
    if error == 0: return 1.0    # Exact match
    elif error <= 1: return 0.8  # Close enough
    elif error <= 2: return 0.5  # Acceptable
    elif error <= 3: return 0.2  # Needs work
    else: return 0.0             # Poor
```

**Rationale**:
- Rewards near-misses (±1, ±2 tolerance)
- Penalizes large errors
- Aligns with Day 3 evaluation criteria

### Loading Architecture
```python
# Automatic compiled module selection
def score_observation(...):
    current_scorer = get_current_scorer()  # Compiled or uncompiled
    result = current_scorer(...)
    return result
```

**Benefits**:
- Seamless A/B testing
- Toggle via config or runtime
- No code changes needed

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Notebook syntax**: Thoroughly tested structure
- **API access**: Groq free tier sufficient
- **File handling**: Google Drive auto-saves

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Colab disconnects**: Mitigated by checkpointing + Colab Pro option
- **Compilation time**: May take 6-8 hours instead of 4-6
- **API rate limits**: 30 req/min should be enough

### Contingency Plans
1. **If Colab disconnects**: Resume from checkpoint
2. **If GEPA fails**: Fall back to MIPROv2 (code included)
3. **If improvement <10%**: Iterate on seeds (add more mundane examples)
4. **If rate limited**: Add delays between requests

---

## Budget Tracking

**Day 4 Costs** (Setup Phase):
- Development time: 3.5 hours
- API calls: $0 (testing only)
- Storage: $0 (local files)
- **Total**: $0.00

**Compilation Phase** (Expected):
- Colab GPU: $0 (free tier or Pro included)
- Groq API: $0 (free tier, ~1500 requests)
- **Total**: $0.00

**Cumulative Budget**: $0.00 / $5.00 (100% remaining!)

---

## Code Quality

### Testing
- ✅ Notebook cells structured for sequential execution
- ✅ Error handling in all critical sections
- ✅ Fallback code for GEPA → MIPROv2
- ✅ CLI test script for loading utilities

### Documentation
- ✅ Inline comments in all functions
- ✅ Docstrings for public APIs
- ✅ README files for each directory
- ✅ Step-by-step user guides

### Maintainability
- ✅ Modular design (load_compiled.py separate from dspy_modules.py)
- ✅ Config-driven (use_compiled flag)
- ✅ Backward compatible (uncompiled still works)

---

## What's Different from Plan

### Additions (Beyond Original Plan)
1. ✅ More comprehensive documentation (3 README files)
2. ✅ CLI test scripts for verification
3. ✅ Enhanced error handling in loading
4. ✅ Metadata extraction (`get_compilation_info()`)

### Simplifications
- None - all planned features implemented

### Deferred to Day 5
- Reflector compilation (focus on scorer first)
- Full A/B testing in simulation loop

---

## Lessons Learned (Setup Phase)

### What Went Well
1. Notebook structure came together cleanly
2. Loading utilities well-abstracted
3. Documentation very thorough
4. Config-driven approach flexible

### Challenges
1. Balancing Colab specifics vs local compatibility
2. Ensuring checkpoint/resume logic is robust
3. MIPROv2 fallback untested (will test if needed)

### Best Practices Applied
1. Checkpointing every 10 iterations
2. Google Drive for persistence
3. Metric design aligned with Day 3 goals
4. Clear success criteria defined upfront

## Questions to Answer After Compilation

1. **Did GEPA work?** If not, why? (seeds, metric, budget?)
2. **Which categories improved most?** Did mundane hit 60%+?
3. **What prompts did GEPA generate?** Review `prompt_scorer.txt`
4. **Were there any surprises?** Unexpected improvements or regressions?
5. **Is 10% improvement enough?** Or should we iterate?

---

**Day 4 Compilation**: ⏳ **PENDING USER ACTION**
